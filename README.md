## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
### A little bit about me:
I'm a junior developer and I'm passionate about programming video games and coding in general.

### Here are a few languages I've spent time on along with associated frameworks/engines (if any):
- python3 + pygame
- lua + lÃ¶ve2d
- gdscript + godot

### Basic knowledge of these languages:
- C++
- HTML
- MakeFile

### I haven't published all of my projects on github but so far here are the languages of those I have:
